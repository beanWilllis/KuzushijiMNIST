# Kuzushiji-MNIST Neural Network

# Overview
This is a personal projectinspired by the MNIST assignment in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization.
I Utilized the KMNIST dataset from https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist. I built a 3-layer neural network from scratch with 25,15,10 nodes using ReLU activations, softmax output, gradient descent, and L2 regularization.
I trained the deep learning model of the 60,000 samples of training data and tested it on the test data to get an accuracy of 38%.
